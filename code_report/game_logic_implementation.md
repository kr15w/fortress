# Game Logic Implementation Analysis

## Findings

### Lobby Scene (src/pages/game/Lobby.js)
- Implemented keyboard simulation:
  - 'r' key: Simulates player 2 entering the game
  - 'e' key: Toggles player 2's ready state
  - Click interaction: Toggles player 1's ready state
- Includes animation states (enter, idle, ready)
- Handles game state (p1Enter, p2Enter, p1Ready, p2Ready)

### Match Scene (src/pages/game/Match.js)
- Basic scene setup with sprites
- No gameplay logic implemented
- No player move simulation

### Menu Links (src/pages/Menu.tsx)
- Both "Join Game" and "Create Room" point to same "/game" route
- No distinction in functionality

## Current Limitations
1. No player move simulation in match scene
2. No backend connection implemented
3. Lobby and game scenes not fully connected

## Recommendations
1. Implement move simulation in Match.js:
   - Keyboard controls for player actions
   - Visual feedback for moves
2. Distinguish between "Join Game" and "Create Room" flows
3. Plan backend API integration
4. Connect lobby ready states to match initialization
